The Zope Bugtrackers
====================

The Zope project uses the `Launchpad platform <http://launchpad.net>`_
for managing bugreports.

Zope Toolkit
------------

The `zopetoolkit project group on Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net/zopetoolkit>`_ is an "umbrella" for the various
ZTK projects, each of which has its own bugtracker (see the project links
on that page).  You can see an overview of bugs across all ``zopetoolkit``
projects:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zopetoolkit


Zope 2
------

Zope2 developers tracks bugs within Zope2 using the ``zope2`` project on
Launchpad:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/

notifications from Launchpad for each new or updated bugtracker issue are
sent to the ``zope2-tracker`` mailing list:

 http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/zope2-tracker

To work on bugs in the ``zope2`` project, you need to be member of the
Zope 2 developer team on Launchpad.  Join the team:

 https://launchpad.net/~zope2-dev


Grok
----

The Grok developers track their bugs using the ``grok`` project
on Launchpad:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok

To work on bugs in the ``grok`` project, you need to be member of the
BlueBream developer team on Launchpad.  Join the team:

 https://launchpad.net/~grok-development-team


BlueBream
---------

The BlueBream developers track their bugs using the ``bluebream`` project
on Launchpad:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bluebream

To work on bugs in the ``bluebream`` project, you need to be member of the
BlueBream developer team on Launchpad.  Join the team:

 https://launchpad.net/~bluebream


Zope 3
++++++

Zope3 bugs are tracked within the ``zope3`` project on Launchpad:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3

.. note:
   Most effort in this project these days is devoted to migrating
   the bugs to other, active projects (``zope2``, ``bluebream``, ``grok``,
   or one of the ``zopetoolkit`` projects).
