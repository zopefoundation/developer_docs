Bug Trackers for Zope-related Projects
======================================

The Zope developer community uses the
`Launchpad platform <http://launchpad.net>`_ for managing bug reports.


.. _ztk-bug-tracker:

Zope Toolkit
------------

The `zopetoolkit project group on Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net/zopetoolkit>`_ is an "umbrella" for the various
ZTK projects, each of which has its own bug tracker (see the project links
on that page).  You can see an overview of bugs across all ``zopetoolkit``
projects:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/zopetoolkit


.. _zope2-bug-tracker:

Zope2
-----

Zope2 developers track bugs within Zope2 using the ``zope2`` project on
Launchpad:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/

Notifications from Launchpad for each new or updated issue are
sent to the ``zope2-tracker`` mailing list:

 http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/zope2-tracker

To work on bugs in the ``zope2`` project, you need to be member of the
Zope 2 developer team on Launchpad.  Join the team:

 https://launchpad.net/~zope2-dev

   the bugs to other, active projects (``zope2``, ``bluebream``, ``grok``,
   or one of the ``zopetoolkit`` projects).
