Becoming a contributor and getting commit access
================================================

1. Get an account at http://www.zope.org.  Pick a user id that is a valid Unix
   user id. Include this id when you fill out the contributor form.

2. Print, fill out and sign the `Zope Contributor Agreement <_static/Contributor.pdf>`_


3. Submit the agreement in one of 3 ways (in order from fastest to slowest):

   - Email a scanned copy to jim@zope.com.  In the email, CC and also mention
     an existing contributor who can vouch for you. 

     Turnaround for this is typically less than a business day, unless I miss
     your email.

   - Fax the agreement to: +1.703.995.0412

     Include the name and email address of an existing contributor who can
     vouch for you.  Please write this in the margins of the agreement.  If I ever
     revise the agreement, I'll include a space for this....

     Turnaround for this is typically a business day or two, mainly because I
     don't get faxes directly.  Someone has to forward faxes to me by email.

   - Mail the agreement to the address given on the agreement.

     Include the name and email address of an existing contributor who can
     vouch for you.  Please write this in the margins of the agreement.  If I ever
     revise the agreement, I'll include a space for this....

     Turnaround for this is typically a few day, if mailed from the US to an
     almost indeterminate amount of time if mailed from outside of the US.
     Agreements mailed from outside the US have taken weeks on occasion.

4. Wait for an acknowledgement. If you don't get this in a reasonable amount of
   time, then nag jim@zope.com, or J1m on the freenode #zope3 IRC channel.  A
   reasonable time depends on the way the agreement was sent, as described above.

4. Upload your SSH public key at: https://cvs.zope.org/upload-key.html

   When you go to that page, you'll get a basic auth login prompt.  Use your
   www.zope.org login and password.

   If you have trouble, **do not ask Jim Fulton for help.**  Ask for help on
   the IRC channels. People there may ask me to look at ssh logs on the server or
   at the uploaded keys, as I am able to access those.

   One thing to keep in mind is that the user id you use to access the
   subversion and CVS repositories is your zope.org user id.  This means that you
   might have to specify a id explicitly. I know of two ways to do this:

   - Include it in the subversion url: svn+ssh://your_zope_org_id@svn.zope.org/repos/main/some_path

   - Specify the user if to use for svn.zope.org (or cvs.zope.org) in your SSH configuration.
     See the SSH documentation for details.
