Browsing the Repository
=======================


Subversion Web Interfaces
-------------------------

The main Subversion Repository provides a
`web interface <http://svn.zope.org>`_ allowing developers to browse the
repository.  This interface uses the `ViewCVS software
<http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/>`_;  please consult the documentation there
for using its features.

The `Programmers of Vilnius <http://pov.lt>` team maintains a `Trac-based
repository browser <http://zope3.pov.lt/trac/browser>`_.


Bazaar Branches
---------------

Many Zope-related projects have mirrors of the "trunk" of their project
in Subversion imported into Launchpad as Bazaar branches.  These imports
provide a web interface as well, allowing developers to browse the source,
the changeset history, and any outstanding merge requests.  See for instance
the ZTK project group's branch overview:

  https://code.launchpad.net/zopetoolkit

and the "zope.org" project group's branch overview:

  https://code.launchpad.net/zope
