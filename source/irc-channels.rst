Zope IRC Channels
=================

The various Zope developer communities use several IRC channels for
communication:

`#zope <irc://freenode.net/#zope>`_
------------------------------------

This channel serves the Zope2, Zope3, and ZTK developers.  These
developers hold a weekly half-hour meeting in the channel on Tuesdays
from 15:00 - 15:30 UTC.

Logs for the channel are available: http://zope3.pov.lt/irclogs-zope/


`#zope3-dev <irc://freenode.net/#zope3-dev>`_
---------------------------------------------

This channel serves the Zope3 and ZTK developers.  Some people prefer it
over `#zope` since it's free of legacy Zope2 issues that sometimes muddle
things up.

Logs for the channel are available: http://zope3.pov.lt/irclogs/


`#grok <irc://freenode.net/#grok>`_
------------------------------------

This channel serves the Grok developers.

Logs for the channel are available: http://jw.n--tree.net/irclogs/grok


`#bluebream <irc://freenode.net/#bluebream>`_
---------------------------------------------

This channel serves the BlueBream developers.
